A question within the context of this lab assignment.

Ok I read that arrow functions inherit the binding of this, rather than have their own binding. But I still can't quite understand it.

An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment

I think arrow functions will be a manageable adjustment after some practice. It makes sense. But it has some tricky caveats. 

How long you spent working on this assignment?
A little over an hour.
